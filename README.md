# oh-my-zsh-custom
My 'custom' directory for `oh-my-zsh`

## Installation
Clone the repository in your `oh-my-zsh` repository, making sure the directory
is named `custom`. Note that this directory already exists, so if you already
have custom plugins/settings, you'll need to make a backup of the directory
first, or just copy the files you want from here. Make sure to use the
`--recursive` option if you want the plugins I have installed; otherwise, why
would you be cloning this repository?

```bash
rm -rf $ZSH_CUSTOM
git clone --recursive https://github.com/evanthegrayt/oh-my-zsh-custom.git $ZSH_CUSTOM
```

much to improve or fix, but if you find something, please [submit an
issue](https://github.com/evanthegrayt/oh-my-zsh-custom/issues/new).
